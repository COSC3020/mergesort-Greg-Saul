# Mergesort

Implement an iterative (no recursive calls) and in-place version of mergesort.
Use the template I've provided in `code.js`. Test your new function; I've
provided some basic testing code that uses
[jsverify](https://jsverify.github.io/) in `code.test.js`.

Hint: To make merge sort in-place, think about what happens during the merge --
where are elements moved to and from? To make it iterative, think about the
part of the array each recursive call considers.

## Runtime Analysis

Analyse the time complexity of your implementation and give a $\Theta$ bound for
its worst-case runtime. Add your answer, including your reasoning, to this
markdown file.

### Analysis

The worst-case $\theta$ time complexity for the in place merge sort would be $\theta (nlogn)$ this is because the outer loop runs $n/2$ times which asymptotically goes to n. The inner loop runs $logn$ times so that it can get the correct depth of the merges. Since they are nested loops you multiply them together to get the time complexity of $\theta (nlogn)$
